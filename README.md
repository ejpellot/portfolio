This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Portfolio
The whole idea for this project is to create my first ever portfolio which will highlight my photography and web design.

## What are my Goals?
I have a few but the one I'm most interested in is integrating Instagrams API to display my photography throughout my website.
I completely understand HTML and CSS but I still want to work on my Javascript so having some type of functionality on my site would be great!

## Conclusion

This project is for me to learn and understand Web Developement with a practical excerise.
